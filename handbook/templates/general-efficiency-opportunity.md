## Issue Body Template

### Context

_Provide the work context where this friction was discovered:_
- Original task or issue: [Link]
- Session or PR: [Link]
- Step or workflow where friction occurred: [Describe]

### Blocker Type

_Select one:_
- [ ] Missing tool / CLI feature
- [ ] Workflow misalignment (steps unclear, sequence wrong)
- [ ] Information gap (doc missing / unclear)
- [ ] Tool/API limitation (capabilities insufficient)
- [ ] Workaround required (standard procedure has exception)
- [ ] Other: _______________

### Severity

_Impact on role execution:_
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Blocks task completion; no workaround available
- [ ] **HIGH:** Adds significant time/effort; workaround exists but is manual/complex
- [ ] **MEDIUM:** Adds some friction but task completes; minor workaround or delay
- [ ] **LOW:** Nice-to-have improvement; minimal impact on execution

### Impact

_Quantify the efficiency loss:_
- Estimated time lost per occurrence: _____ min
- Frequency (est. per sprint/month): _____ times
- Cross-role applicability: [ ] Single role | [ ] Multiple roles | [ ] All roles

### Workaround Used
