# General SOP: Process-Improvement Loop

**Role(s):** All roles  
**Triggers:** After each substantive task; on efficiency feedback patterns  
**Authority:** Governance, AGENTS.md

## Purpose

Ensure that every agent execution includes systematic reflection on operational efficiency and captures friction points, workarounds, and improvement opportunities for cross-role analysis and implementation.

## Standard Workflow

1. **Complete a substantive task** in the scope of your role.
2. **Reflect** using the question: *"How could this have been more efficient?"*
3. **Assess findings:**
   - If only a local workaround was used, document it and continue.
   - If a reusable friction pattern emerged, file an **efficiency-opportunity** issue.
4. **File efficiency issue** (if applicable):
   - Link to the original work context (issue, PR, session).
   - Document: blocker type, severity, impact, workaround used, suggested fix.
   - Apply labels: `efficiency-opportunity`, `agent-feedback`.
   - If an equivalent open issue exists, link and append new evidence instead of duplicating.
5. **Report implementation status** on efficiency issues:
   - When a fix is implemented, post a comment: "Implemented in [PR/issue]".
   - When escalated or deferred, explain and link the decision artifact.
   - Close the feedback loop to show the impact of agent feedback.

## Escalation Conditions

- Blocker is a missing tool or feature (escalate to Context-Engineering).
- Friction affects multiple agents or roles (link cross-role pattern to Context-Engineering implementation issue).
- Suggested fix requires protected-path approval or governance change.
- Pattern indicates systematic workflow misalignment across roles.

## Completion Criteria

- Efficiency reflection is documented in session logs or commit messages where applicable.
- Efficiency-opportunity issue filed if a reusable friction pattern is identified.
- Issue includes all required fields (blocker type, severity, impact, workaround, fix suggestion).
- Cross-role patterns are linked to Context-Engineering implementation issues.
- Feedback loop is closed with implementation status updates.
