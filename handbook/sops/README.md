# SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

Store repeatable procedures here (general and role-specific).

Each SOP should include:
- Purpose and trigger
- Inputs and prerequisites
- Step-by-step procedure
- Outputs and completion criteria
- Escalation conditions

General SOPs should be prefixed with `general-`.
